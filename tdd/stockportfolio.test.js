/*
Reflection:
At first it was kind of difficult to write the test cases because I wasnâ€™t used to starting from nothing. 
Not having existing code to go off of made it challenging to picture what the functions should look like, 
but over time I started enjoying the freedom of naming my own functions and knowing exactly what the tests 
should return before writing the actual code. It took a little longer than usual to complete everything, 
but I liked the process a lot more since it made me think more critically and stay engaged since I was constantly 
switching between writing tests and implementing code.
